# Assignment 4: Keras classification

Classify different datasets wth keras. Perform the needed pre-processing steps for each data-set, create a model, train it while checking it with a validation set, and test it with a test set. Improve the model as needed to achieve a classification accuracy of at least 85%.

**Rubric:**

1. The pre-processing for each data-set is correct.
2. The labels are one hot encoded.
3. Created a validation set for each data-set.
4. Created a neural net model for each data-set.
5. Used different techniques to avoid over/underfitting and improved the classification.
6. Plot the history of each model: plot training and validation, loss and accuracy.
7. Evaluate the model with the test set.
8. Included comments as needed.
9. For each model, add a cell that describes the process you followed to design, and improve the model.
